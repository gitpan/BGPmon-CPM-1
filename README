BGPmon-CPM-Demo version 1.0.0a
============================

This package includes the Critical Prefix Management (CPM) website and 
supporting modules.

INSTALLATION

Please Note: If other BGPmon DB tools have previously been installed it is
likely that the bgpmon_db_user and bgpmon_db have already been created. If that is the case, skip to step 6.

This package depends on being able to connect to a postgres installation.
The following instructions will help prepare that installation, installation
procedures may vary across platforms.
1. Install Postgresql (sudo apt-get install postgresql)
2. Create the database user bgpmon_db_user (sudo -u postgres createuser)
3. Create the database bgpmon_db (sudo -u postgres createdb bgpmon_db)
4. Give a user other than root or postgres access to the database 
     (should include web user): 
   Edit /etc/postgresql/8.1/main/pg_hba.conf to give specific users access
   Refer to postres documentation for assitance editing the pg_hba.conf file
5. Restart postgres
6. Create the CPM schema
   bin/bpgpmon_cpm_db_reset 
7. In order for the modules to access the scripts a password should be set
   on the bgpmon_cpm_user role. (alter role bgpmon_cpm_user password 'passwd';)
   This password needs to be saved in lib/BGPmon/CPM/DB.pm 
   make test will fail if this is not completed

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

After module installation you need to copy the webpages (under www) to a 
location known to your web server. The web server will also need to be able to 
find the modules.
